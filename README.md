# Detection of Fake Accounts in Social Media Using Machine Learning

# ABSTRACT 
The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to an increase in fake accounts that engage in spam activities, spreading misinformation, and other malicious actions. To combat this issue, we propose a machine-learning model capable of distinguishing between real and fake user accounts. This project utilizes logistic regression, a well-established classification algorithm, to analyze user account features and predict their authenticity.The dataset used for training and testing the model comprises various account attributes, such as username characteristics, bio descriptions, number of posts, and followers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals significant patterns: fake accounts tend to have more numeric characters in their usernames, shorter bio descriptions, and minimal engagement in terms of posts and followers.The logistic regression model is implemented with and without regularization, demonstrating the impact of L1 and L2 penalty functions. Performance evaluation is conducted using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores. The model without regularization achieves an AUC score of 96%, while the regularized model scores 77%, indicating slight overfitting in the latter.To further refine the model, GridSearchCV is used to optimize hyperparameters, enhancing predictive accuracy. The final model achieves an AUC of 93.9% on test data, confirming its reliability. The system also allows the platform management to set classification thresholds, giving them control over account suspension decisions based on model predictions.
